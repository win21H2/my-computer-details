Please note that if you would like to contribute you have to either<br>
A:<br>
DM me via Discord (my username is `324Hz#4539`) with the exact message below (you can copy and paste it)

`Hello 324hz, I would like to help contribute to your repository "my-computer-details". My username on Github is [YOUR GITHUB USERNAME] and I am requesting with the UUID 662895f4-b576-4890-86bf-a83cfc24543c`

or B:<br>
PM me via Twitter (my username is `@win21H2`) with the exact message below (you can copy and paste it)

`Hello 324hz, I would like to help contribute to your repository "my-computer-details". My username on Github is [YOUR GITHUB USERNAME] and I am requesting with the UUID 662895f4-b576-4890-86bf-a83cfc24543c`

This will allow me to see who I can and cannot accept PRs from and this is an important step because if you make a PR without sending me this, I will <u>NOT</u> merge it!
